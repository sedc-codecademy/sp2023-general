# Free APIs and helpful pages âš¡
APIs are a great way to build an app with real live data without having a back-end applicaiton. There are a lot of Open APIs that does not require any payment or credit card to actually give you live data. These sites usually are limited to number of requests you can do in an interval of time. For some you may have to create an account and obtain an API key as well, in order to use the data, but they are still free. Here are some links to some open APIs or aggregate data about open APIs:
