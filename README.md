# SEDC Project Mentorship üöÄ

## Welcome üëã
Welcome to the SEDC Project Mentorship program, we are very happy to have you onboarded. This document will be the main hub for information, announcements and helpful links and resources that you will need through-out the course of this period of time. 
### Goal  ü•á
The goal of this program is for every team to implement a student product as a web-based application so that students show their skills and determination to build stuff and to advance in their field. Students will have full control over the projects and the development process. This means that the final product will be a solution completely designed and devoted by the students. The process will be monitored by the mentors and they will provide help and feedback when things get confusing and rough. Doing these projects do have benefits for the students, including: 
* Learn to be part of Agile team
* Learn to use industry standard tooling
* Learn to work on open source project / product
* Learn to deploy to publicly available location 
* Get technical mentorship 
* Start building personal CV with IT project involvement

## Lectures Tracks and Semesters üóì
* 1st semester, 1 track
  * Frontend JavaScript Web Development (G1-G9)
* 2nd semester, 2 tracks

  * Elective subjects

## Project types üéà
* Student product
  * [Developer Tech Blog](https://github.com/sedc-codecademy/Student-Projects-2023/blob/master/Projects/TechBlog.md)
  * [News Aggregator Site](https://github.com/sedc-codecademy/Student-Projects-2023/blob/master/Projects/NewsAggregator.md)
  * [Crypto Simulator](https://github.com/sedc-codecademy/Student-Projects-2023/blob/master/Projects/CryptoSimulator.md)
  * [Drop-shipping Web Store](https://github.com/sedc-codecademy/Student-Projects-2023/blob/master/Projects/DropshippingStore.md)
  * [Productivity Web App](https://github.com/sedc-codecademy/Student-Projects-2023/blob/master/Projects/ProductivityApp.md)
* Partner project
  * N/A

## Team Structure for Student projects üí™
For the teams that will work on client projects the teams will be organized: 
* Students
  * 8-14 x Web Developers
  * 1 x Team representative ( Picked from the people already in the team )
* Technical mentors
  * Web Development

### Mentor responsibility üì¢
A mentor responsibility will be to guide and assist the students through-out the process of design and development of the projects. This can be done through giving students feedback, consult on issues and give directions when the students get stuck or have some dilemma about the project, the code or the idea in general. Every team will have a chance to contact the mentor and ask for a feedback, but since the goal is to build an independent project, this feedback should be limited to:
* 1 x technical mentorship feedback during initial kick-off meeting
* 3 x technical mentorship feedback related to overcoming technical issues during development / execution of first team demo
* 1 x technical mentorship feedback related to application final touches, final demo event and project phase closure

### Student as team member responsibility ‚öΩ
A student as team member responsibility will be to plan the course of the development process for their project. A team member needs to spend at least 40 hours on the project. Because there are multiple members, this number is multiplied by the number of team members. Every team member needs to have a part in the project and should present their work on each iteration demo.
Related to demos, it's expected:
* After the first 3-4 weeks, the mentor is expected to organize an internal team demo and invite team members only
* At the end of the phase, SEDC will organize final demo event and the mentors will help identifying the teams and team presenter(s) that will be invited based on their overall progress accordingly

### Documentation of project üìù
Documenting the project is important. The code should be uploaded and updated frequently on github. But documentation on the goals and aims of the project are also important, and initial documentation will be provided within each project GitHub repo.

### Projects timeline
#### [1st phase] 0 iteration 
 * **6th March** E-mail notification was sent to all students containing projects application form, enabling students to select preferred projects, and optionally suggest team members.
 * **16th March** Mentors will be onboarded over an online meeting, and assigned to 1 or 2 student teams accordingly. Project requirements and tooling, including Trello board, GitHub repos, and Slack team channels will be created for each project team, and tech mentors will be assigned access as administrator. Student teams will be informed over e-mail about their respective tech mentor, and invited to join Slack workspace containing all project team channels for further mentor-to-students collaboration. Slack related, mentors and students will need to initially enroll to SEDC Student Projects 2023 workspace, using following URL: https://join.slack.com/t/slack-hjx3242/shared_invite/zt-1raq7k6oy-CeVNkP2oUhrVQZX0B8HI9A
 * **17th March** E-mail notification will be sent to each project with students in To, and mentor in Cc.  
 * **18th ‚Äì 25th March** Mentors should organize project kick-off meetings with student team members. Kick-off meeting should be scheduled using Google Meet (direct integration with Slack), or other video-conference tooling based on mentors and team preference. Tech mentors will also need as administrator of the Slack private channel to assign access to students in order to continue chat collaboration on Slack. Tech mentors will also need to assign access to GitHub repo and Trello board where they will also have Administrator access. During project kick-off meeting, tech mentors should share students project process, expectations, and milestones as described in next chapters.  

#### [1st phase] 1st iteration 
 * **27th March ‚Äì 1st April** Students should get familiar with the requirements, create Trello backlog items (if not already), and start planning first activities 
 * **3rd April ‚Äì 13th May** Students should complete 1st iteration. Tech mentors should organize demos using Slack. 

#### [1st phase] 2nd iteration 
 * **15th May - 1st July** Students should continue more independently with project activities. Tech mentors should mentor when needed / requested using Slack team channels. 
 * **8th July** Execute final demos and complete FE projects. 
 
#### [2nd phase]
 * TBD
